## results <- analysis(data)
For this problem set, your task is write out pseudocode for the analyses you'll need for your project. Think about all of the steps you'll need to transform your raw data into the central summary measures and statistical tests that will reveal your amazing findings. What summary measures do you need to answer your research question? Do you need to recode variables (e.g., recode responses into correct vs. incorrect), manage potentially missing data, or try to find outliers? Write out the logical steps in an organized and structured format. If you don't know all the details of your analysis, that is fine. Go with something that's sensible. But, the closer you are to the actual analysis you will implement, the more helpful this assignment will be later on!

## Deliverables
Your submission should be 1 text file with:
- A brief paragraph explaining the raw data from your experiment (what are your IVs and DVs?) and the summary measures you'll need to compute (e.g., accuracy, median reaction times, average confidence ratings)
- Your pseudocode that details how you'll turn raw data into findings
